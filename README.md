# LetterPuddle

## About

this is just a nice little animation on the console.

There will be a middle Letter (the initial drop)
growing outwards from this there will be other letters spawing in place.
Like a Puddle that start with a drop and grows into a splat puddle thingy.

## Logic

The surrounding empty spaces will be assigned a Letter based on the Letters that surround them.
What Letter will be spawned is random, but there is an increased chance for the letter to equal one of the letters it is surrounded by.
